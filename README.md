# ImageSharpExtensions
Extensions for the ImageSharp library. Includes new methods and some faster drawing methods. At the time of writing, there is currently a pull request (not mine) on the ImageSharp repo for faster IPixel implementations that may make some of these drawing methods obselete.  
  
**Requirements**
* [ImageSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/2.1.3)
* [My vector library](https://github.com/Jacbo1/Vector-Library) (could easily be replaced/removed)
